        As a member of the Junior Chamber International Abuja Unity Group,
        Abuja, Nigeria for approximately seven years, Precious Ebere was
        responsible for the execution of numerous projects assigned to her,
        including “The Educational impact Project”, geared towards supporting
        and improving the quality of education in schools, with the goal of
        making them fit and conducive for learning, and by effect, advancing the
        goal of SDG 4. The Educational Impact Project won the Organization
        AU$40,000 from the Australian Embassy in 2016, and she was also involved
        in other tasks within various projects (producing books, leaflets,
        posters, budgets, etc.). With her computer skills, she was also very
        useful for helping over 30 farmers' children gain computer knowledge in
        a Project called Smart Agriculture: so many of them were, with her help,
        able to improve their computer skills and knowledge in agricultural
        research and production.

          In 2021, Precious was selected as the first female Nigerian to
          coordinate the Commonwealth Students Association (CSA) Network, United
          Kingdom. She has also served as the Vice President, Postgraduate
          Executive, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom and sits on both
          local and international boards.

          In 2018, following a real time survey, Precious discovered that
          Nigeria suffers lots of issues, from reducing 10.2 million
          out-of-school children to a situation where unemployment rate jumped
          from 18.1% to 23.1% between 2017 and 2018, which has been
          disproportionately borne by young people with almost 30% of them out
          of work. Precious came up with an Innovation called DO Skill Up Climb
          Up, a 10-year Skill-Up-Climb-Up human capacity development project, (

          ). It was primarily targeted at addressing the challenges of skills
          deficit, poverty, unemployment rates and unpreparedness of both
          African businesses and the teeming population of young people for the
          future of work and globalization. The 10-year Skill-Up-Climb-Up human
          capacity development project was designed to impact 50,000 young
          people by 2030, with ongoing projects in Abuja, Rivers and Taraba.
          This initiative has empowered over 500 women, 50 creatives, and
          provided employment for 20 creatives.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the Ministerial round table on ICT for skills development
          hosted by the African Union and Government of Botswana in 2019, the
          Skill-Up-Climb-Up initiative was applauded as the 21st century
          innovation to look out for. Various States in Nigeria have indicated
          interest to replicate this initiative in their States. The initiative
          is contributing to the achievements of improving access to quality
          education and opportunity for young people using Skills and Human
          Capacity Development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the span of 6 years, she has worked actively to ensure women,
          girl children and youth get access to inclusive and quality education
          and equal opportunities through her various initiatives at “DO”
          (dotakeaction.org), and over 10,000 lives have been tremendously
          impacted through her work. Her work and impact were featured in a
          France journal publication:
          https://olbios.org/if-you-want-to-change-the-minds-change-the-infrastructure/
          and also on a United States Magazine and Podcast:

          <br />
          <br />
          These milestones are worth recognition on a global stage.
          <br />
          With DO, Precious' future plans are embedded in her VISION STATEMENT:
          Change by Africans for Africa. She sees a Nigeria where every
          Nigerian, irrespective of tribe, age, religion, takes individual
          responsibility for Africa's change and sustainable development, whilst
          making a difference in their community. All this whilst spreading her
          tentacles in the African community, to drive sustainable development
          at scale by building an active community of young and old people
          taking action at every turn, to solve key issues facing their
          communities. Precious' Goal by 2030, is to build an active community
          of young and old people taking action to solve key issues facing their
          communities, factoring the below-stated metrics.
